- In the aspect of time, I'm considering leaving off casting and validation of changesets and pushing everything straight through to ETS. If I have time at the end I will add those in.

- As the alloted amount of time I wanted to spend on this is running over now, I think the last thing I would like to do is generate some historical data so that it can be shown that multiple dates of goals can be edited. Also I'd like to finalise a couple tests, I usually don't like to write a bunch of tests when prototyping something as I want to move piece by piece and iterate as I need, tests make that painful. My commits relating to how I chose to store the data will likely show that.

I also don't know if I'll spend the time on the reporting feature as its getting late unfortunately.
